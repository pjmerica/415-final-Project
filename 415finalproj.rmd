When plotting all the predictors against life expectancy in a scatter plot, life expectancy seems to be most correlated with status of the country, adult mortality, alcohol, BMI, diphtheria,  HIV/AIDS, income composition of resources, and schooling. In most of the scatterplots, there appears to be a lot of outliers. However, this may be due to getting rid of the NA values in the data set in the data cleaning process. When looking at the correlation coefficients for the relationship between these 8 predictors and life expectancy, the five most strongly predictive features of life expectancy are adult mortality, BMI, HIV/AIDS, income composition of resources, and schooling with schooling being the top most predictive feature of life expectancy.

# Linear Regression Method
```{r}
trainlife = newlife[1:floor(0.7*nrow(newlife)),]
testlife = newlife[-(1:floor(0.7*nrow(newlife))),]

colMeans(newlife[-c(1,2,3)])
apply(newlife[-c(1,2,3)], 2, sd)
# The means and standard deviations of the design matrix vary significantly, therefore, it is imperative to standardize the data.

mean_train = colMeans(trainlife[-c(1,2,3)])
std_train = apply(trainlife[-c(1,2,3)], 2, sd)

X_life_train = scale(trainlife[-c(1,2,3)], center = mean_train, scale = std_train)
y_life_train = trainlife$Life_expectancy

X_life_test = scale(testlife[-c(1,2,3)], center = mean_train, scale = std_train)
y_life_test = testlife$Life_expectancy

mod1 = lm(Life_Expectancy ~ Adult_Mortality + BMI + HIV.AIDS + Resource_Income + Schooling, data = trainlife)
summary(mod1)

# Training and Test Errors
train_predict = predict.lm(mod1, trainlife)
train_mse = mean((train_predict - trainlife$Life_Expectancy)^2)

test_predict = predict.lm(mod1, testlife)
test_mse = mean((test_predict - testlife$Life_Expectancy)^2)

cat("The training MSE for the model fit by OLS is", train_mse,".\n")
cat("The test MSE for the model fit by OLS is", test_mse,".\n")

plot(mod1)
# When looking at the diagnostic plots, the data appears to be fairly normal, therefore, the linear fit for the model is appropriate.
